RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 neorv32_top_inst/neorv32_boot_rom_inst_true.neorv32_boot_rom_inst/rdata_reg has an input control pin neorv32_top_inst/neorv32_boot_rom_inst_true.neorv32_boot_rom_inst/rdata_reg/ADDRARDADDR[13] (net: neorv32_top_inst/neorv32_boot_rom_inst_true.neorv32_boot_rom_inst/ADDRARDADDR[8]) which is driven by a register (neorv32_top_inst/neorv32_busswitch_inst/FSM_sequential_arbiter_reg[state][0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis.
